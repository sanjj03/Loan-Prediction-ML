# Loan-Prediction-ML
A machine learning project to predict loan approval using Random Forest
# ğŸ§  Loan Default Prediction System

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant demographics and financial information.

## ğŸ“Œ Overview

Loan approval is a crucial part of the banking process. This project builds a classification model using **Random Forest** to predict loan approval status using features like income, credit history, and more.

## ğŸ’¼ Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## ğŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is a public loan approval dataset which includes:
- Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Education
- Property Area
- Loan Status (target)

## ğŸ”§ Project Steps

1. Imported and explored the dataset using Pandas
2. Cleaned missing values
3. Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder
4. Trained a Random Forest Classifier
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy score (Achieved ~77%)
6. Visualized insights using Seaborn & Matplotlib

## ğŸ“Š Visualizations

- Countplot of loan approvals
- Income vs Loan Amount scatter plot
- Loan approval by property area
- Correlation heatmap

## âœ… Results

- **Model Accuracy**: ~77%
- Random Forest model performed well on classification task
- Valuable insights into which features influence loan approval

## ğŸ§  Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience with data preprocessing
- Building a classification model from scratch
- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Understanding feature importance in predictive tasks
